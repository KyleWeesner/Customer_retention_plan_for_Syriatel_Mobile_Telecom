# Customer retention plan for Syriatel Mobile Telecom
 
 
Author: Kyle Weesner
 
## Overview
Syriatel Mobile Telecom is a service pervider that currently serves more than 8 million people today having 199 international roaming partners in 116 countries.  As a data scientist, I am currently creating a model to predict when might customers stop doing business with us.  By building a model to help predict when customers will deter away from our service we can either offer additional resources to make the customer happier and improve our services that may be not opitimal at the same time.  This is a great way to see where improvements to our company may need to be done. 


## Business Problem
Service providers strive to maintain a healthy balance between gaining new customers while minimizing those who switch providers.  As a business we want to maximize profit where it can be done without making unhappy customers, so one place this can be done is the retention rate of customers.  With our predictive model, we will improve features in our business that seem to have a correlation with leaving customers and at the same time offer additional support to customers who are considering leaving our service.  

 
## Data
For model building we used data from [Churn in Telecom's dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset) aquired from kaggle.  This data file is available in the project repo in the folder "data".  

 
## Tools
A productive model was made with a combination between the data and tools used in this project. 
- This report uses pandas for datafram manipulation and data analysis.  
- Sklearn for statistical modeling and machine learning.
